## To run locally:

```
./launcher.sh
```

### Note that:

- ```--train_data_name``` can be used to use to set the training dataset.

- Hyperparamaters can be changed in ```exp_configs.py```.
  - The tokenizer to be used is treated as a hyperparameter and then must also be set in ```exp_configs.py```
